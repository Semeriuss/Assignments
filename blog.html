                How does a Browser interpret a 200px font-size?
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    As pixel (px) refers to an absolute unit of measure in size, in contrast with the relative units such as <em>em</em> and % values, the computer browser would interpret it directly by assigning it the specified amount, in this case 200px. A default font-size of 16px is an absolute measure for the browser and hence assigns that particular amount as a given (if not overridden in the cascading style sheet). When the browser is assigned a default of 200px, then unlike the relative unit of measures which expand or shrink the size as a direct function of the default value, it would assign the font-size of values an exact measure in the display as long as the device is compatible with the value of the size.

                Relative Units for Styling - Does it matter which?
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Both <em>rem</em> and <em>em</em> are relative units, unlike px, which is an absolute one. While <em>em</em> is relative to the font size of its direct or nearest parent,<em>rem</em> is only relative to the html (root) font-size. The main problem with <em>em</em> units is that they are relative to the font size of their own element. As such they can cascade and cause unexpected results. The main issue with using <em>rem</em> for font sizing is that the values are somewhat difficult to use. 
                    <li>10px = 0.625rem</li>
                    <li>12px = 0.75rem</li>
                    <li>14px = 0.875rem</li>
                    <li>16px = 1rem (base)</li>
                    <li>18px = 1.125rem</li>
                    <li>20px = 1.25rem</li>
                    <li>24px = 1.5rem</li>
                    <li>30px = 1.875rem</li>
                    <li>32px = 2rem</li> <br>
                    The use of <em>em</em> or <em>rem</em>   units inside media queries is concerned with what is the optimal line length and how it affects the user's reading experience. <em>rem</em> and <em>em</em>  units, when used as units for media queries, always keep the same value of <br> 1<em>rem</em>  = 1<em>em</em>  = browser-set font size unlike what they normally do in normal circumstances. Relative units in media queries are never based on results of declarations. For example, in HTML, the <em>em</em>  unit is relative to the initial value of font-size, defined by the user agent or the user’s preferences, not any styling on the page. <br><br> The ability to scale based on the root font size makes <em>rem</em> units very useful for accessibility. Google developers make the recommendation to use relative units for text sizing. There is an empirical study run by the people behind the Internet Archive showing that there is a significant number of users who change their default font size in the browser settings. By using <em>rem</em>  and other relative units the web designer respect the users’ decisions about the way they want to browse the web. <br><br> A third use we can find for <em>rem</em> units is to build scalable components. By expressing widths, margins, and padding in <em>rem</em> units, it becomes possible to create an interface that grows or shrinks in accord with the root font size, meaning the html's. As element padding values and margins are expressed using <em>rem</em> , the entire component scales with the device size. <br><br>In conclusion, the advantages in using <em>rem</em> units in our code is abundant, such as responsiveness, scalability, improved reading experience, and greater flexibility in defining components. However it must be noted that, <em>rem</em> units is not a panacea for every styling problem and is only a very powerful styling tool when utilized cautiously and meaningfully.

                What's New in CSS3?
            </p>
            <article>
                <p>
                    <strong><em>CSS3</em></strong> is the latest version of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. The following are the major additions in CSS3. <br>
                    <h2><em>New Animative Properties</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        There are quite a few new properties in CSS3, many of which do what web page authors have been doing for years with various contortions of HTML, images, and JavaScript. Examples: <br> <br>
                       <strong>opacity: 0.5;</strong> Makes an element 50% opaque <br>
                       <strong>border-radius: 6px;</strong> Creates a rounded effect with a 6px curvature on each corner <br>
                       <strong>box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px #373737;</strong> A shadow 5px long, 5px high, a blur of 10px and a dark grey color. <br>
                       <strong>text-shadow: topOffset leftOffset blurRadius color;</strong> Adds shadow to individual characters in text nodes. <br>
                       <strong>background: linear-gradient (to right[direction], red[color-stop1],yellow [color-stop2], …);</strong> Displays a linear gradient of colors which is specified in the direction. <br>
                       <strong>background: radial-gradient(circle [shape size at position – default is ellipse],red, yellow, green);</strong> Creates a radial color gradient. <br>
                       <strong>background-image: url(firstImage.jpg), url(secondImage.gif),url(thirdImage.png);</strong> Provides us with the ability to add more than one background image to any element, even to pseudo-elements. <br>
                       <strong>transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out; </strong> The transition property specifies a property to transition into and out of, (in this case opacity), how long to take to do the transition and the easing function, so it’s gradual. <br>
                       <strong>opacity: 0;  </strong> By setting opacity to 0, say on a hover event, we can create a disappear/reappear animation.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h2><em>New Layouts</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a couple of powerful new ways to lay out your page with CSS that go beyond positioning and are much easier to use. Examples: <br> <br>
                       <strong>display: table;</strong> <br>
                       <strong>display: table-cell; </strong> This gives you a table layout without the HTML tables. <br>
                       <strong>display: flexbox;</strong> <br>
                       <strong>flex-order: 1; </strong> With flexbox you have greater control over how the browser flows boxes, like div's onto the page. <br>
                    </p>
                    <h2><em>New Pseudo-classes</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        In CSS1 and CSS2, pseudo-elements were preceded by single colons, just as pseudo-classes were. In CSS3 and later, pseudo-elements use double colons to distinguish them from pseudo-classes. For historical reasons, browsers will support both single and double colons on pseudo-elements, but the double-colon syntax is recommended.<br> <br>
                       <strong>:root - </strong> Allows designers to point to the root element of a document. In HTML, it is html since :root is generic, it allows a designer to select the root element of an XML document without necessarily knowing it’s name. <br>
                       <strong>Eg. root{overflow: auto} </strong> Permits scrollbars when needed in a document, this rule would work. <br>
                       <strong>:last-child - </strong> Added as a complement to the first-child selector, which can select the last element named of a parent element.  <br>
                       <strong>Eg. div.article > p:last-child{font-style: italic;} </strong> Changes the font for last paragraph of a site with articles  contained in div class=’article’ /div tags, where each has a last paragraph with some information that needs to be uniformly stylized.<br>
                       <strong>:target - </strong> Selector draw the user’s attention to a span of text when the user clicks on a same-page link. <br>
                       <strong>Eg. span.notice:target{font-size: 2em; font-style; bold;}</strong> <br>
                       <strong>:not - </strong> The negation pseudo-class selector selects specified elements that doesn’t meet a particular specification. <br>
                       <strong>Eg. img:not ([border]) {border: 1;} </strong> Puts a border around images that don’t have a border specified. <br>
                    </p>
                <h2><em>New Colors</em></h2>
                <p>
                    New way of describing colors. Previous versions either required hexadecimal format such as #FFF, or #FFFFFF for white). It was also possible to declare colors using the rgb() notation either integers (0-255) or percentages.
                    In CSS3 color module, the color keyword list has been extended to include 147 additional keyword colors (generally well supported).<br> <br>
                   <strong>rgba() - </strong> Works just like RGB representing red, green, and blue pixel values, except it adds a fourth value: alpha, the opacity level or alpha transparency level. For the alpha value, 1 means fully opaque, 0, is fully transparent, and 0.5 is 50% opaque. Any number between 0 and 1 is viable.<br>
                   <strong>hsl() and hsla()  </strong> Stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. Unlike RGB, where you need to manipulate the saturation or brightness of a color by changing all three color values in concert, with HSL you can tweak either just the saturation or the lightness while keeping the same base hue. The syntax for HSL comprises an integer value for hue, and percentage values for saturation and lightness. <br>
                   <ul>
                       <p>The hsl()/hsla() declaration accepts three values: </p>
                       <li>The hue in degrees from 0 to 359. Some examples are: 0 = red, 60 = yellow, 120 = green, 180= cyan, 240=blue, and 300 = magenta. This is based on the VIBGYOR-visible light wavelength distribution.</li>
                       <li>The saturation as a percentage with 100% being the norm. Saturation of 100% will be the full hue, and saturation of 0 will give you a shade of gray – essentially causing the hue value to be ignored.</li>
                       <li>A percentage for lightness with 50% being the norm. A lightness of 100% will be white, 50% will be the actual hue, and 0% will be black.</li>
                       <li>The <em>'a'</em>, like the rgba() stands for alpha transparency.</li>
                   </ul>
                </p>
                <h2><em>New Selectors</em></h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a whole slew of new selectors, including nth-child, which lets you
                        target specific child elements enclosed in an element. In CSS1, matching of elements by type, class, and/or ID was allowed. CSS2 introduced several attribute selectors and added pseudo-elements, pseudo-classes, and combinators. CSS3 expanded three more attribute selectors which allow selecting substrings.
                    <br> <br>
                       
                       <strong>Element[attr^=val] </strong>  <br>
                       <strong>Eg. a[href^=’http://developers.’]{color: crimson’}  </strong> Matches any element E whose attribute a starts with the value http://develops.’<br>
                       <strong>Element[attr$=val] </strong> <br>
                       <strong>Eg. a[href$=’.java’] {color: red;} </strong> Matches any element a whose attribute href ends in .java.<br>
                       <strong>Element[attr*=val] </strong>  <br>
                       <strong>Eg. img[src*=’gallery’]{border-color: #a7e7ec #BBB #FFF #a7e7ec;} </strong> Matches any element img  whose attribute src matches ‘gallery’, except the value can be part of a word.<br>
                       <strong>ul li:nth-child(2n) { color: gray; }</strong> This means: select every alternating rows in a list item and set the background color to gray.
